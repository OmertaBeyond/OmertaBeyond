# OmertaBeyond

## About

Omerta Beyond is, simply, an userscript for the MMORPG [Omerta](http://www.barafranca.com).  
It helps you with the game without you having to open a new window for Latest News, Family Info and much more.  

It is still a work in progress and we will always be adding new updates as you can see at our changelog.  
All of these separate addons are optional, there is a preference pane to turn each one on/off.  

## Compatibility

At the moment OB is fully compatible with:


* Firefox  
  * [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  
  * [Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/)
